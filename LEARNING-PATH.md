# 🎓 CloudSec Sandbox Learning Path

## Phase 1: Environment Setup ✅
- [x] Apache2 web server configured
- [x] DVWA deployed and functional
- [x] OWASP Juice Shop running
- [x] Security configurations applied
- [x] Git repository connected

## Phase 2: DVWA Vulnerability Testing
### 🎯 SQL Injection
- [ ] Basic SQL injection (Low security)
- [ ] Bypass authentication with SQL injection  
- [ ] Extract database information
- [ ] Advanced blind SQL injection (High security)

### 🔍 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- [ ] Reflected XSS exploitation
- [ ] Stored XSS payload creation
- [ ] Cookie stealing via XSS
- [ ] XSS filter bypass techniques

### 📁 File Upload Vulnerabilities
- [ ] Upload malicious PHP files
- [ ] Bypass file extension filtering
- [ ] Execute uploaded web shells
- [ ] Image-based payload injection

### 💉 Command Injection
- [ ] Basic command execution
- [ ] Chain multiple commands
- [ ] Bypass input filtering
- [ ] Privilege escalation attempts

## Phase 3: OWASP Juice Shop Challenges
### 🧃 Beginner Level (⭐)
- [ ] Find the Score Board
- [ ] Provoke an error that is not very gracefully handled
- [ ] XSS Tier 1 challenges
- [ ] Access a confidential document

### 🧃 Intermediate Level (⭐⭐)
- [ ] Login Admin without password
- [ ] Access someone else's basket
- [ ] Post some feedback with another user's name
- [ ] Change Bender's password

### 🧃 Advanced Level (⭐⭐⭐+)
- [ ] Retrieve a list of all user credentials
- [ ] Log in with the administrator's user account
- [ ] Forge an essentially unsigned JWT token
- [ ] Perform a Remote Code Execution attack

## Phase 4: Network & System Security
### 🔍 Reconnaissance
- [ ] Port scanning with Nmap
- [ ] Service enumeration
- [ ] Banner grabbing
- [ ] Directory enumeration

### 🛡️ Defense Implementation
- [ ] Configure additional firewall rules
- [ ] Set up intrusion detection
- [ ] Implement log monitoring
- [ ] Create security hardening checklist

## Phase 5: Documentation & Reporting
- [ ] Screenshot all successful exploits
- [ ] Document vulnerability details
- [ ] Create remediation recommendations
- [ ] Build professional security report
