# 🔐 Cloud Security Sandbox: Attack Simulation and Defense for Learners

A **Mini Cloud Security Operations Center (SOC)** designed for students and cybersecurity enthusiasts to simulate real-world attacks, detect them, and build custom defensive responses — all in a safe, cost-free environment.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Most cloud security tools like AWS GuardDuty or Azure Security Center are enterprise-focused, expensive, and restrictive.  
This project bridges that gap by offering a lightweight, educational SOC environment where learners can:

- Host intentionally vulnerable websites (like **DVWA** and **Juice Shop**)  
- Simulate common web-based attacks (SQLi, XSS, Brute Force)  
- Collect and analyze security logs  
- Visualize attack patterns using **Grafana** or **Kibana**  
- Send real-time alerts through **Telegram**, **Slack**, or **Email**

---

## 🧠 Learning Goals

- Understand the basics of **offensive and defensive security**
- Learn how **SOC systems** detect and respond to incidents  
- Gain hands-on experience with **Docker**, **Linux**, and **web attack simulation**  
- Visualize threats using open-source tools instead of paid enterprise solutions
